# Slate Engine & Editor

*Create, Iterate, Share*
</div>

## About
Slate Engine & Editor is a high performance multiplatform 3D game engine that is coupled with its own editor application.

This is a hobby project of mine I started in my first year of college because of the abundance of time on my hands and heavy interest in graphics programming. 

## Install
I'll make a website to host builds of it, but as of now you're just going to have to compile it yourself (sry).
(todo: write how to for compile manually)
